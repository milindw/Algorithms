This is a clustering application using Kruskal's algorithm to find the MST of a graph.
The clustering stops when the desired number of clusters are reached.

Also included is a variation where distances between nodes are not provided, instead the hamming distance for each node is given,
and the distances are relative hamming distances between each node.
